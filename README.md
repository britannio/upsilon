# Upsilon - A Cluedo Solver [Flutter](https://flutter.dev) App

## Motivation
I lost a game of [Cluedo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluedo) and from then onwards I wanted to find an optimal winning strategy that I could utilise.

## Usage Instructions

1. Select the cards dealt to you.
2. Press the start button.
3. Select a card + player combination everytime information about a player's cards is found
4. Press the solve button.
5. Repeat step 3 until a single character, room and weapon remain.
6. You've won! *

\* There's a RNG element to the game, and the algorithm being utilised has room for improvement so winning isn't gauranteed.
